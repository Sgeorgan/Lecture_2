    "Let’s consider our list `station_names`. As we know, we already have data in the list `station_names`, and we can modify that data using built-in methods such as `station_names.append()`. In this case, the method `append()` is something that exists for lists, but not for other data types. It is intuitive that you might like to add (or append) things to a list, but perhaps it does not make sense to append to other data types. Below, let's create a variable `station_name_length` that we can use to store the length of the list `station_names`.
