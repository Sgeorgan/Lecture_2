    "- **Code Comments**: These are snippets of text embedded within code cells, serving as signposts that guide the user through the code's logic and flow.\n",

    "In the universe of Python programming, code comments act as silent observers. They reside amidst your Python script, yet remain passive during execution. Their role? To offer contextual explanations, enriching the narrative of your code's functionality and logic. Python recognizes two primary flavors of code comments, which we'll unpack below.\n",

    "Inline annotations or line comments, as they are conventionally termed, kick off with the `#` symbol. Post this character, all ensuing text on that line retreats into the shadows, evading the Python interpreter's notice. Such comments typically serve as succinct descriptors for individual code lines or a compact cluster of them. Let's delve into an illustrative example.\n"
